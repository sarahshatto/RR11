CHAPTER 16: IMAGES 

* Controlling the size of an image 
    * using the width and height properties in CSS 
    * Whenever you have consistently sized images across a site, you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.
    * To do this, create a class within the image tag, and target the class in CSS
* alight-left or align-right 
* float property allows text to flow around the image within the box. 
* By default, images are inline elements, so if you need to center an image, it must first be turned into a block level element using the display property with a value of block. 
    * Once this has been done, you can use the text-align:center property, or you can set the margin property with left and right to zero. 
* Background images 
    * background-image property allows you to add a background image to any element. By default, it will repeat until it fits the designated container. 
                                    body {
                                    background image: url ("images/pattern.gif");
                                    }
    * repeating: 
        * repeats both vertically and horizontally 
        * repeat-x : horizontally only 
        * repeat-y : vertically only 
        * no-repeat: 
        * fixed: image stays in the same position on the page
        * scroll: background image moves up and down w/ scrolling
    * background-position: when not repeating, you can choose where the background image sits. 
* Image rollover: when a user moves their mouse over a link or button, the element can have a second style. 
* sprite: when a single image is used for multiple parts of an interface
